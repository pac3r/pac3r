Write a single-page website code. The page has a background color of #df1b3fff with a white big title and subtitle centered vertically, and a contact email at the bottom. All texts are left justified (but with a margin on large screens). I want the font for title and subtitle to be Railway extra bold, but the font of the contact to be a more usual one. 

Please invent a surralist subtitle announcing an exciting new startup, but without any reference to a product.
